One of the burning debates in South Africa is around land redistribution. It has  been said in recent months, notably by the Economic Freedom Fighters, that most of the country's land is in the hands of a white minority.

But the land question is much broader than South Africa. Many a war have been waged the world over because of borders, or the natural resources within those borders.
 
We can safely say that the wars between Ukraine and Russia, between Israel and Gaza, and on the Congo are all land-related. But do we know how land has changed hands over time?

This project is not about dictating who is the rightful or wrongful owner of a patch of land, but it aims to learn from history and hopefully inform land policies.

Our implementation will be heavily dependent on how readily we can find information about who holds the 'title deeds' of land property in an observed area.
